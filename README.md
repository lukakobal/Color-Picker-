# 🎨 Color Picker App – React Day 26

Small React app with two components:
- **ColorPicker** – user selects a color  
- **ColorDisplay** – shows selected color  
- State lives in **App.js**

Concepts practiced:
- State lifting (child → parent communication)
- Multiple components working together
- Passing props down + sending functions up

### 🔧 Personal Note
This project was built on a special day — I'm currently moving into my **new house**, which I’ve been renovating myself for the past months. 🚚🏡  
Still coding, even during the move. Discipline stays strong. 💪

A small app for a big day.
